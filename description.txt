The application is a database connector, it allows you connect to mysql and postgresql.
you put your query that you would like to write in the top big text box.

fill out the form inputs of username, ip, database, password and hit execute

the program will run the query and return a table which will fill the datagrid on the bottom half of the application.

Packages that I used are the SQL connector and the postgresql connector both of which can be installed from Nuget

https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql/

Tools -> Nuget Package manager -> open command line

use install commands from the package pages
